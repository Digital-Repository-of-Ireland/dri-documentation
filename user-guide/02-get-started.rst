Get Started
===========

This chapter describes how to get started with the Repository. It covers
how to navigate the site and create an account.

End user agreement
------------------

When you visit the Repository for the first time you will see the DRI End User Agreement (:numref:`fig-agreement`).
In order to continue to the site you must choose to agree with this. Should you not agree 
you will be re-directed to the DRI website.

Creating an account
-------------------

Searching and viewing public collections and objects can be done without having an account on the Repository.
Some functions, however, are only available to registered users |learnusers|.
