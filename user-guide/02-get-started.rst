Navigating the site
-------------------

From the Repository homepage you can navigate to all sections of the site. You can choose to view
one of the featured collections or objects, or to see all collections available

Initially the search results displayed are all collections available. Use the pagination links in 
the top right (2) to navigate the results. Your search can be refined using the facet bar (3) on the right.
Some of the collections in the Repository include sub-collections within them. If you would like these
to be included in the displayed results click the Sub-Collections tab (4). To hide them simply click the tab
again.

Selecting the Objects tab will allow for searching all the objects available in the Repository.

As stated you can filter the results of your search using the facet bar (1). Clicking on a facet within the bar will
expand the available filtering options (2). Select one or more of these options and the filtered results will be
displayed. The selected filters will be shown at the top of results display (3). Filters can be removed
from the search by clicking the white X in either the facet bar, or beside the filter (4) in the list
