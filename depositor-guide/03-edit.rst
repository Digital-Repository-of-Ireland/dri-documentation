Editing 
========

This chapter describes the various editor tools available for objects and collections.

Collections
------------

The available options for editing a collection can be found in the editor tool menu 
'Edit Collection' dropdown. The content of this dropdown will vary depending on
the role that has been granted to your user account.

The options for editing are:
 * **Cover image** if a cover image is added to the collection it will be displayed in search results
 * **Edit metadata** edit the collections descriptive metadata using form entry
 * **Replace metadata** replace descriptive metadata by uploading an XML metadata file
 * **Access controls** edit the collections access controls
 * **Licence** choose a licence to apply to the objects contained in the collection. The selected licence
   will be displayed on the object pages

It is also possible to associate organisations with the collection by selecting 'Manage Organisations' from the
editor tools. In the Manage Organisations modal there are two lists, the available organisations on the left (1)
and those that are currently associated with the collection on the right (2). Move organisations between the lists
by selecting them and using the right (3) and left (4) arrows. At least one of the associated organisations should be set as the
depositing organisation by selecting the organisation in the depositing organisation drop down (5). 
Save your changes by pressing 'Set Organisations'.
